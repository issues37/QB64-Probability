# QB64-Probability-Tree
 A simple 3-phase probability tree animation

A member in a Discord server I belong to, who goes by the nickname "issues37", sent me this message:

> @ðŸŒŸ The Joyful Programmer ðŸŒŸ seems i by accident almost created a "probability tree" while attempting to make a vehicle simulator with intersections..

I responded with:

I was intriqued with issues37 screenshot and had to create something similar. Not to out do him, but to test myself to see how I would create something similar.

I went through several iterations of the demo until I finally created one I really liked, which I now share here on GitHub for all to enjoy. Here's a few screenshots of the demo:

Issues37's demo had two-way intersections for the "cars" (dots) to chose from: Left and Right. I added a third way in my demo, which is straight ahead.
